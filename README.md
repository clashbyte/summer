# Summer in the City

Take a break and explore pixelated city!

This project is using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) as a base template. No libraries used except GLMatrix, React and ESLint.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits, but it's highly recommended to make full page reload because of static classes usage. \
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
